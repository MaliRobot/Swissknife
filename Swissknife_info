Project Swissknife

Modular program written for purposes of Arma 3 game server maintenance written for Comrades in Arms (CiA) clan.
You can use it as well if it fits your needs.

This is supposed to be a modular program for mining new mp missions for Arma 3, formating them, making a list and uploading the
list to google docs.

Modules made so far:
First module (203) - unpacks and edits mission files according to CiA standards, generates filenames from data within files.

Requirements:
cpbo - for mission unpacking, you can download it from here: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=411
Osku's Tool - (link coming up)

How to run it:

Make a directory structure like this after you compile Swissknife (it's best to compile it to a single exe file):

Osku's tool
│   swissknife.exe   
|   extract.bat
|   repack.bat
|   reset.bat
|   < new_missions_list.csv - this is where extracted data from mission files is presented >
│
└───cpbo
|   │   cpbo.exe
│
|───_backup_
|   |   < backups of mission files >
|   |   ...
|
├───input
│   │   < mission files ready to be processed >
│   │   ...
│
└───output
|   |   < repacked edited mission files >
│   |   ...
